# Speed Typing Test

This is a simple web-based speed typing test application created by Avishkar Deshmukh. The application allows users to test their typing speed by providing a random quote for them to type within a specified time.

- **Timer**: The timer keeps track of the time taken by the user to type the given quote.
- **Words Per Minute (WPM) Counter**: The application calculates and displays the user's typing speed in words per minute.

## Usage

1. Open the application in a web browser.
2. Start typing the displayed quote in the textarea.
3. The timer will start as soon as you begin typing.
4. The application will highlight correct and incorrect inputs in real-time.
